# 2012 Presidential Election Results

The Huffington Post collected county-level election results from the websites of the election authority in each state, parsed the data and converted them into a common format.

The resulting comma-separated-values files can be found in the `/data` directory.

The unprocessed source data for each state can be found in the `sources` directory. That directory also contains a `sources.csv` file, which lists the URL from which each results file was downloaded.

The repository currently includes county-level results from every state except Massachusetts and Alaska. It also includes results for the District of Columbia and town-level results for Rhode Island.
