2012 Presidential Election Results
=============

This repository contains official county-level results for the 2012 general presidential election.

All results were from the relevant state's website. They were then parsed and converted into a common format.

The resulting comma-separated-values files can be found in the data directory.

The source data for each state can be found in the sources directory. That directory also contains a sources.csv file, which lists the URL from which each results file was downloaded.
